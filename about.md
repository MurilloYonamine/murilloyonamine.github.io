I'm Murillo Yonamine, a game developer in training, focused on programming, gameplay systems, and prototyping. I'm currently studying Digital Games, where I develop projects that explore both the technical and creative aspects of game development.

I mainly work with Unity and C#, creating 2D and 3D games, movement systems, interactive mechanics, and playable prototypes. I have experience with academic projects, game jams, and personal initiatives, always aiming to write clear, testable, and scalable code.

In my portfolio, you'll find complete games, experimental prototypes, and ongoing projects published on itch.io, as well as repositories on GitHub that document my learning process, technical decisions, and evolution as a programmer.

I have a special interest in gameplay systems, technical design, internal tools, and code architecture, and I'm constantly studying new technologies and approaches to improve the quality of my projects.

This site brings together my work, experiments, and studies—a practical view of what I can do today and what I'm building for the future.
